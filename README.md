# knapsack-solver-gui
Semestral project for MI-PYT. 

Task of this project is to optimize with Cython all solutions of knapsack problem implemented in subject MI-PAA, and add GUI, which will be used to load input file in format used in MI-PAA, choose which algorithms to run and plot and to set parameters for chosen algorithms.

Algorithms to be implemented:
* bruteforce
* branch and bound
* cost to weight ratio heuristics
* dynamic programming
* FPTAS (parameter epsilon - maximum allowed relative error)
* simulated annealing (with parameters: start temperature, stop temperature, cooling coefficient, equilibrium)
